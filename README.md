# Chess
Exercise id 0006 from acmp.ru

This is an exercise for checking if the horse move in chess was correct. The only line in the input file INPUT.TXT contents the horse move 
string ("C7-D5" for example). The string musn't be empty and longer than 5 characters.

In the output file OUTPUT.TXT must be written "YES" if the move is correct, "NO" if the move is incorrect, but the coordinates can be defined (like «E2-E4»),
and "ERROR" if the coordinates can't be defined («D9-N5» or «DF6» for example).
